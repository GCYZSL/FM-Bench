"""Deterministic relevance-retrieval over the agent's own notebook.

The `retrieval` memory mode borrows ONE idea from skill-library agent memory designs —
*retrieve the relevant subset instead of dumping the whole store* — in its
lightest possible form:

  - no embeddings, no vector DB, no external knowledge — the notebook is still
    written by the agent itself and holds only what the agent chose to remember;
  - retrieval is pure whole-word/tag matching against a query derived from the
    current decision-stop packet, so it is fully DETERMINISTIC (same notebook +
    same packet => same ordering). That matters: fm-bench's audit rests on
    `seed + action log = bit-identical replay`, and an embedding-ANN retriever
    would inject non-determinism. This does not.

The engine is untouched: `world.notebook` stays a plain string, and this only
transforms the VIEW of it the agent is shown at each stop (runner-side). So it
is a measurable harness variant (`memory_mode=retrieval`) to compare against the
flat notebook, not a change to the frozen default harness.

Note format: one note per line. A note may carry inline `#tags` (e.g.
`#finance #board sold striker to balance wages`); tags are matched against the
situation query just like ordinary words, but the `#` is stripped for display.
